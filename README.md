# How to build & deploy

This website is hosted on GitHub pages at the repo this README file is present in. I've written a script for automating the entire build and deployment process, which you can find here - [Gatsby GitHub Deployment Script](https://github.com/RushDynamic/gatsby-github-deployment-script)

### Using the script

Make sure all of your changes have been committed and pushed to **'develop'**. Then run the following commands:

```
cd ./code
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```
